My friend Shanni is a legend, and on his 26th birthday, I'm reminded <br>
how much he means to me. He's my best friend Beve's boyfriend, and I <br>
used to take him for granted, thinking he'd always be there to queue <br>
up for Overwatch, where he's a total beast, or to send me another <br>
wild, racist Instagram reel we crack up over. You expect friends to <br>
be around, hyping you to try new game strats or blasting Kendrick <br>
Lamar's new album. He pushes me to step up, in gaming or appreciating <br>
a sick rap verse, and it used to bug me. Now, I'm all in.</p>
		<p class="small-copy yellow justify">
Our Korea trip this year was epic. Shanni was a pro at calling Ubers, <br>
navigating Seoul's streets like a boss. From Olive Young to Gyeongbokgung, <br>
he had it covered. Hearing him spit Kendrick's bars or geek out over Breaking <br>
Bad plot twists is peak Shanni. I can't wait for him to finish Better Call <br>
Saul so we can nerd out over Saul's schemes. When he DMs me racist or <br>
transphobic reels, it means he’s still here, still Shanni.</p>

		</ul>
		<p class="small-copy white">
Shanni's a gaming genius and he's annoyingly good. He knows wild stuff, like <br>
optimal flank routes or how patches shift the meta. He drops these facts <br>
without realizing how nerdy he sounds; he's just that into gaming. He breaks <br>
down strategies like he's cooking up a Breaking Bad plan and carried me <br>
through It Takes Two when no one else would, and I'm grateful. Our crew <br>
knows he's a beast.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
I used to be just Beve's friend, but now I'm Shanni's friend too, and our <br>
bond's only gotten stronger. He expects everyone to bring their A-game, just <br>
like he does. If you're slacking, he'll call you out - no mercy. That's how <br>
he is, in games and life. It pushes me to level up, whether I want to or not. <br>
I used to want to stay in the background, but Shanni makes me shine. He hypes <br>
me up, whether I'm clutching a play or sending anti-poly reels. Not every <br>
friend vibes like that. It's why he's Beve's boyfriend and my bro.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
This birthday's huge because Shanni's been there through it all. He grinds <br>
games, swaps reels, and keeps our Korea trip vibes alive. He deserves the best. <br>
Shanni's about keeping it real for Beve and our crew, we want him to have a <br>
day as awesome as he is. Happy 26th, Shanni - here's to more wins, reels, <br>
and finishing Better Call Saul!</p>
