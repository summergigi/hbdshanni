My friend Shanni is incredible, and I’m reminded of that every day, <br>
especially as we celebrate his 26th birthday. He’s my best friend <br>
Beve’s boyfriend, and honestly, they’re the ultimate duo—like a <br>
perfectly timed Junkrat ult in Overwatch or a Psylocke combo in <br>
Marvel Rivals, his two favorite games where he absolutely dominates. <br>
I used to take him for granted, like he’d always be there, ready to <br>
carry our squad or school me on game mechanics. You expect your <br>
friends to just be around, bugging you to join their ranked matches, <br>
practice new strats, or hype you up to “git gud” so you can be a <br>
better gamer one day. He’s always pushing me to try new heroes or roles, <br>
even when I’d rather stick to my comfort zone, and yeah, it used to <br>
drive me nuts. But now? I cherish every moment of it.</p>
		<p class="small-copy yellow justify">
When we traveled to Korea together this year, Shanni was a lifesaver, <br>
calling Ubers like a pro to get us through the bustling streets of Seoul. <br>
Whether it was navigating to Olive Young or Gyeongbokgung, he had it handled. <br>
Now, every time he pings me to join a match or nags me about positioning <br>
in Overwatch, I feel lucky. Those Discord calls where he’s hyped about a <br>
clutch play or ranting about a team’s bad comp? I love them. Even his <br>
over-the-top victory cheers after a winning streak make me smile—it means <br>
he’s still here, still Shanni.</p>

		My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.<br>
		I mean, super brainiac annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the most random stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like<br>
		how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br>
		And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it<br>
		takes up about 9% more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt<br>
		into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level<br>
		will go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He<br>
		doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.<br>
		I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to cook<br>
		because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br>
		cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he<br>
		goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.<br>
		He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
		The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to<br>
		hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br>
		(Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser<br>
		shoes he always wears).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.<br>
		Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.<br>
		The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,<br>
		and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's<br>
		how he is at home and at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only just figured out what a good qual-<br>
		ity	that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what<br>
		made me brave, too when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I wanted to be or not.<br>
		Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of<br>
		my dad being a teacher there I was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize two things now.<br>
		First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.<br>
		And two, he's the right dad for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br>
		cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a<br>
		lot of other dads I've met.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be disappointed because they're into<br>
		sports or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure<br>
		wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It<br>
		makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care<br>
		about what the kids at school say anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is he's a good<br>
		teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he<br>
		cares.&nbsp;&nbsp;After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the <br>
		best.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do<br>
		for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, for his students, and for me and my family.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
		It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not<br>
		that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that,<br>
		but it was sure a bad time for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom was pregnant with what she calls<br>
		a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby she's<br>
		actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay<br>
		all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't<br>
		have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;And<br>
		my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-<br>
		ity.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I'm doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because I want to make him mad or<br>
		upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
		One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a<br>
		regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't<br>
		take insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that's wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, one of the big reasons why<br>
		my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he<br>
		didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my<br>
		dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we want him<br>
		around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as<br>
		possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we<br>
		can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with<br>
		him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want her to<br>
		know him for herself.</p>
